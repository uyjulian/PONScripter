* TO BUILD PONSCRIPTER FOR YOUR USE

This is the usual

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

This will use gcc by default; to use icc, start with

  CC=icc ./configure

If you have problems, try using internal libraries as described below.
You may need to tweak linker flags manually -- unfortunately SDL is
not very good at reporting which libraries it depends on.  (On
Solaris, for example, it will happily use GNU's iconv headers, and
then forget to reveal that it requires libiconv.)

Other compilers are unsupported; some (Microsoft's cl and Sun
WorkShop) are known not to work.


* TO BUILD A RELATIVELY REDISTRIBUTABLE PONSCRIPTER BINARY

  ./configure --with-internal-libs
  make

This will statically link as many libraries as possible into the
executable, which makes life better on systems with primitive
application installation methods, such as OS X and Windows.
 
If you are compiling Ponscripter for a system with modern package
management - for example, if you are creating a binary package for a
specific Linux distribution - then it will make more sense to omit the
--with-internal-libs, compile a dynamically linked executable, and
have your package depend on the regular platform-specific packages for
SDL, Freetype, and all the other dependencies.  This will simplify
your life somewhat.


* NOTES

For Windows builds, use a MinGW toolchain in the MSYS environment.
