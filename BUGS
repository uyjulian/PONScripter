MINOR

* Line-breaking takes place consistently one character too soon when fast-forwarding.
  (The problem is that character advancing takes place immediately before the text is
   rendered in regular mode, and immediately after in fast-forward mode.)
  (So far I can't find a fix. The code is too crufty.)

AESTHETIC

* Charter italic: f (and ligs) still slightly narrow in "product" section...

FEATURES

* Automatic typographic quotes (initial right quote can be done manually).
* Ligatures: do we perhaps need a ZWNJ?  ^^;
* SHY, NBHY would be nice too... ;)
* OSFs in other styles (bold/bold-italic).  Proportional figures in sans styles?
* Variable text size.

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm getting silly...)
