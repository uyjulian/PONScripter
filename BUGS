MAJOR

* Rendering is wrong when coming out of backlog mode...?
  (To reproduce, enter backlog mode on "...actual words.)" in "Concept", then exit backlog and click to proceed.)
  

AESTHETIC

* "Product" menu is only blue if you haven't used the "return to title" option from the right-click menu (i.e. reset?)
* "... ..." needs kerning

FEATURES

* SHY (U+00AD) support would be nice... ;)
* OSFs in other styles (bold/bold-italic).  Proportional figures in sans styles?

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm getting silly...)
