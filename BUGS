This file is not kept up to date.  Some/all of these bugs may not
actually exist any more.  Consider this "notes", really.

MAJOR BUGS

* A distinction is still being made between END_1BYTE_CHAR and another
  state.  This other state appears not to be useful: its main
  attribute seems to be that whitespace is ignored.  This should
  probably be removed, and the END_1BYTE_CHAR behaviour made
  universal.  TODO: confirm that this will never be undesirable.

* Click-to-display-a-full-page doesn't work in OS X 10.4+ unless
  coalesced updates are disabled.

* Problems using fullscreen mode under Compiz on Nezumi.  The symptom
  is that the game flickers into fullscreen mode and then pops
  straight back into a window.  Something to do with the Workarounds
  plugin, but I've tried disabling workarounds individually and failed
  to isolate the cause.  :(

MINOR BUGS

* FontInfo doesn't store accurate information on extremes, so
  getFullArea(), line_space() etc don't actually return the area
  filled by existing text.
  (TODO: need to check whether this still applies)

* Built-in save/load menus are broken when encoding is Shift_JIS
  (TODO: need to check whether this still applies)


HEISENBUGS

* In Narci2, enabling auto mode and then fast-forwarding may have
  caused me to end up with no text showing and nothing happening till
  I clicked.  This was at the top of the first lift, IIRC.
  (TODO: try to duplicate this.)

* Some fades repeat randomly (doesn't happen in Linux, does in
  Solaris) (can't duplicate this again - WTF was it?)


FEATURES

* Interpolation of %variables and $strings; we can then use #% and #$
  for literal % and $.

* SHY (U+00AD) support would be nice.  Also non-breaking hyphens.

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm
  getting silly...)


NOTES

text_info appears to be the "surface" used to store the text
layer. While in text mode, glyphs are also rendered directly to the
screen, but they are stored on text_info for later use.  Adjusting
this so that glyphs were only ever rendered to text_info -- and that
constantly overlayed on the screen -- would make it easier to arrange
for things like high-resolution glyph positioning (render to high-res
text layer, downsample).
