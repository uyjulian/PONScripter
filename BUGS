This file is not kept up to date.  Some/all of these bugs may not
actually exist any more.  Consider this "notes", really.

MAJOR BUGS

* Problems using fullscreen mode under Compiz on Nezumi.  The symptom
  is that the game flickers into fullscreen mode and then pops
  straight back into a window.  Something to do with the Workarounds
  plugin, but I've tried disabling workarounds individually and failed
  to isolate the cause.  :(

  
MINOR BUGS

* Unmarked text is still permitted.  (It now serves no purpose, so far
  as I know.)

* Click-to-display-a-full-page doesn't work in OS X 10.4+ unless
  coalesced updates are disabled.

* FontInfo doesn't store accurate information on extremes, so
  getFullArea(), line_space() etc don't actually return the area
  filled by existing text.
  (TODO: need to check whether this still applies)

* Built-in save/load menus are broken when encoding is Shift_JIS
  (TODO: need to check whether this still applies)


HEISENBUGS

* In Narci2, enabling auto mode and then fast-forwarding may have
  caused me to end up with no text showing and nothing happening till
  I clicked.  This was at the top of the first lift, IIRC.
  (TODO: try to duplicate this.)


FEATURES

* SHY (U+00AD) support would be nice.  Also non-breaking hyphens.
