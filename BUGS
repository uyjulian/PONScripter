NB. These are all described in terms of Narcissu 2, and may not apply
to other titles.


MAJOR BUGS

* @ mid-line doesn't work (and I could've sworn I tested it! ;_;)
  Ah, probably a textgosub issue.

* The whole program is fundamentally broken in many ways.  For
  example, Narcissu 2's text display is unexpectedly incredibly slow,
  with a 2-second pause before some lines that doesn't happen in older
  versions -- possibly introduced unwittingly during the STL
  makeover.  It's not clear exactly where the problem lies, or whether
  it can be fixed at all...

* Movie playback doesn't work?

* Some fades repeat randomly (doesn't happen in Linux, does in
  Solaris) (can't duplicate this again - WTF was it?)


MINOR BUGS

* Built-in save/load menus are broken when encoding is Shift_JIS


ENVIRONMENT

* Title bar sometimes "stops working" when Beryl is active (title,
  icon, and buttons do not appear, window cannot be moved by dragging,
  and title bar is always in inactive style).  Restarting Beryl seems
  to fix this, so I don't think it can be a Ponscripter bug.


AESTHETIC

* "... ..." needs kerning


FEATURES

* SHY (U+00AD) support would be nice... ;)

* OSFs in other styles (bold/bold-italic).  Proportional figures in
  sans styles?

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm
  getting silly...)


NOTES

text_info appears to be the "surface" used to store the text
layer. While in text mode, glyphs are also rendered directly to the
screen, but they are stored on text_info for later use.  Adjusting
this so that glyphs were only ever rendered to text_info -- and that
constantly overlayed on the screen -- would make it easier to arrange
for things like high-resolution glyph positioning (render to high-res
text layer, downsample).
