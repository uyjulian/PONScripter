/ We should check for very short sentence starts (e.g. rather than "foo. I|think", break as "foo.|I think").

/ Line wrapping fails: tokens break on hyphen, but the next token is not re-scanned.
  (i.e. "three-mi|nute", because "three-" fits on the line, and "minute" is not checked.)
  (Need to check edge cases, allow for nbhy, etc.)

* Indents are not preserved in the backlog.

/ Text button hit testing extends too far below a button by a considerable distance.

* Maybe add an extended lsp that automatically handles text centering?
