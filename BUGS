MINOR

* Line-breaking takes place consistently one character too soon when fast-forwarding.

AESTHETIC

* Charter italic: f (and ligs) rather narrow in "product" section.
* Paragraph spacing -- a whole blank line is far too deep. Time to make y positioning pixel-based? :/

FEATURES

* Ligatures: do we perhaps need a ZWNJ?  ^^;
* SHY, NBHY would be nice too... ;)
* OSFs in italic, too, at minimum.
* Kerning?  :P
