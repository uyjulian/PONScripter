NB. These are all described in terms of Narcissu 2, and may not apply
to other titles.


ENVIRONMENT

* Title bar sometimes "stops working" when Beryl is active (title,
  icon, and buttons do not appear, window cannot be moved by dragging,
  and title bar is always in inactive style).  Restarting Beryl seems
  to fix this, so I don't think it can be a Ponscripter bug.


AESTHETIC

* "Product" menu is only blue if you haven't used the "return to
  title" option from the right-click menu (i.e. reset?)

* "... ..." needs kerning

FEATURES

* SHY (U+00AD) support would be nice... ;)

* OSFs in other styles (bold/bold-italic).  Proportional figures in
  sans styles?

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm
  getting silly...)


NOTES

text_info appears to be the "surface" used to store the text
layer. While in text mode, glyphs are also rendered directly to the
screen, but they are stored on text_info for later use.  Adjusting
this so that glyphs were only ever rendered to text_info -- and that
constantly overlayed on the screen -- would make it easier to arrange
for things like high-resolution glyph positioning (render to high-res
text layer, downsample).
