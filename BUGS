MINOR

* Line-breaking takes place consistently one character too soon when fast-forwarding.

AESTHETIC

* Charter italic: f (and ligs) still slightly narrow in "product" section...
* Paragraph spacing -- a whole blank line is far too deep. Time to make y positioning pixel-based? :/

FEATURES

* Automatic typographic quotes (initial right quote can be done manually).
* Ligatures: do we perhaps need a ZWNJ?  ^^;
* SHY, NBHY would be nice too... ;)
* OSFs in other styles (bold/bold-italic).  Proportional figures in sans styles?
* Variable text size. (Requires pixel positioning? Compatible with backlog?)
* Kerning?  :P
  Should be doable... just peek at next char when determining glyph advance.

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm getting silly...)
