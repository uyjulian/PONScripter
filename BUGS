NB. Some of these are actually Narci2-specific.


MAJOR BUGS

* Click-to-display-a-full-page doesn't work in OS X.

* Some fades repeat randomly (doesn't happen in Linux, does in
  Solaris) (can't duplicate this again - WTF was it?)


MINOR BUGS

* FontInfo doesn't store accurate information on extremes, so
  getFullArea(), line_space() etc don't actually return the area
  filled by existing text.

* Built-in save/load menus are broken when encoding is Shift_JIS


AESTHETIC

* "... ..." needs kerning


FEATURES

* SHY (U+00AD) support would be nice... ;)

* OSFs in other styles (bold/bold-italic).  Proportional figures in
  sans styles?

* Subpixel rendering when running windowed on an LCD?  (Okay, now I'm
  getting silly...)


NOTES

text_info appears to be the "surface" used to store the text
layer. While in text mode, glyphs are also rendered directly to the
screen, but they are stored on text_info for later use.  Adjusting
this so that glyphs were only ever rendered to text_info -- and that
constantly overlayed on the screen -- would make it easier to arrange
for things like high-resolution glyph positioning (render to high-res
text layer, downsample).
