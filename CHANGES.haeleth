  Fix typo in usage summary.

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data no longer has to be
  stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the application bundle, and
  default save path be a new subfolder of the user's Documents.  The name of the subfolder
  is derived from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of 0.txt with
  a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline (if present).
