  Revert setwindow and locate commands to the NScripter behaviour
  (sizes defined in characters not pixels) in all cases, to simplify
  porting.  A new h_locate command is provided as a pixel-oriented
  replacement for locate, while a much improved pixel-oriented
  setwindow replacement is already available in the form of
  h_usewindow.

  Filenames are now checked for non-ASCII text; finding any is
  considered an error.  Life's too short to implement a fully general
  cross-platform encoding-independent file access mechanism.

  Games were randomly segfaulting on my computer, and the problem
  seemed to be related to string handling, so I've taken the
  opportunity to get rid of the horrid pstring interface and replace
  it with something a little saner, based on bstrlib.  Now it doesn't
  segfault any more.

  Fixed some other architectural oddities, notably the far-too-early
  substitution of ligatures; this now doesn't take place until we're
  actually trying to access glyphs, and consequentially we can stop
  worrying about ligature substitution mangling filenames, and we can
  ignore ligature definitions where there's no suitable glyph in the
  active font.

  Support for soft subtitles in MPEG playback (but not, at present, in
  AVI playback).

  Add command logsp2utf -- equivalent to logsp2, but for UTF-8 text.

  Various bug fixes: interaction between default styles and saved
  games, ludicrously inefficient ligature searching, handling of
  overlapping sprite-buttons.

  Remove support for obsolete ONScripter-format saved games.

2007-09-25

  Implement h_defwindow, h_usewindow, h_usewindow3: create and use
  predefined sets of window settings.

  Implement h_speedpercent: adjust all font speed settings
  proportionately with a single convenient command.

2007-07-15

  Fix glyph positioning and a number of OS X build bugs.

2007-06-16

  Merge recent portability enhancements from ONScripter-En: configure
  now works properly on a wider range of Unixes, and generates an
  `install' target as documented.

2007-05-14

  Improve path handling: all paths are now specified explicitly. 

  Full file handling is partly rewritten in a higher-level manner as a
  prelude to making things encoding-independent, but direct access to
  files with non-ASCII filenames is still very much dependent on a
  UTF-8 filesystem.

2007-05-13

  The game identifier can now be derived from caption or versionstr
  commands if the ;gameid directive is absent.

2007-04-28

  Ponscripter games now use slightly different script filenames.
  Limited support for NScripter scripts added; output is by no means
  identical with ONScripter, and many things will not work, but some
  NScripter games are now playable with proportional text (even
  proportional Japanese text!) without any porting.

  Reimplement the clickstr function.

  Fix bug in selectcolor implementation that was causing select
  colours to be lost whenever the interpreter was reset.


2007-04-25

  Merge in an adapted version of the `drawfix' patch to speed up
  screen updates in windowed mode, plus a number of other patches:

  Reduce flicker when sprites are changed (Roine Gustafsson)

  Fix gcc detection on OS X (Roine)

  Support multiple games without game IDs at the same time (Roine)

  Fix incorrect clipping of text shadow (Roine)


2007-04 (passim)

  Major cleanup of source code, including conversion of many aspects
  to use C++ idioms and STL containers.


2007-04-15

  Merge in useful fixes from onscripter-20070206.


2007-01

  Redesign build system to support automatic platform/dependency
  detection and to allow bundling of dependencies.  This makes it
  plausible to distribute the Linux version as source code, since a
  straight configure-make cycle should finally "just work".

  Reimplement menu handling initially stripped out during
  proportionalisation.  Right-click menus now function as in
  ONScripter.  Built-in save/load menus take advantage of proportional
  text to display in automatically-formatted columns.

2006-11-30

  Increase flexibility of file embedding.  Font files can now be
  embedded in the executable: embedded fonts will be used only if the
  file is not found in the data directory or in the game archive.
  Icon embedding is now optional; the embedded icon, if present, will
  be used only if "icon.png" is not found in the working directory.
  The new system could easily be expanded to allow other files to be
  embedded, including game data.
  
2006-11-22

  Implement default data/save separation for Windows and Linux
  too. This should enhance Vista compatibility considerably, and make
  it possible to package Linux versions in a way that respects the
  FHS.

2006-11-21

  Implement ligature customisation.
  
  Integers can now be expressed in hexadecimal with an 0x prefix, as
  in C.

2006-09-24

  Replace SDL_ttf with a simpler, saner C++ interface (the
  implementation still being largely drawn from SDL_ttf, of course).

  Convert horizontal font positioning to use floating-point rather
  than integer offsets.  Begin attempts at subpixel positioning (still
  buggy).
  
  In the process, glyph caching has been removed.  ONScripter uses
  _two_ glyph caches (!) -- one in SDL_ttf, which apparently only
  works on ASCII characters anyway, and one in
  ONScripterLabel. However, the speed of text rendering does not seem
  to be affected at all by removing caching, suggesting that it's a
  premature optimisation.  The code is simplified considerably by its
  removal.

2006-09-18

  Multi-font-style support.

2006-09-14

  Automatic ligature support.
  
2006-09-08

  Default icon embedded in interpreter.  (This is game-specific; users
  are expected to use custom builds with these replaced.)

2006-09-06

  Fork.

  UTF-8 and proportional text support.
  
  Ruby, clickstr, and tategaki support removed.

2006-09-05 (as ONScripter)

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data
  no longer has to be stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the
  application bundle, and default save path be a new subfolder of the
  user's Library/Preferences.  The name of the subfolder is derived
  from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of
  0.txt with a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline.
