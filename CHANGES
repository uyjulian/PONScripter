2009-07-07

  Various bugfixes [Mion]


2009-02-07

  Ligature selection is no longer dependent on the order of
  definition, and a saner data structure is used.


2009-01-20

  Refactor documentation, and translate it to DocBook to make HTML
  generation easier.


2009-01-18

  Refactor source tree into something sane.

  Improve Vista support.

  Add packaging support for RPM- and DEB-based Linux distributions.


2008-12-29

  Tweak script filename detection.

  Define #@, #_, etc by default.


2008-12-28

  Implement variable interpolation in text lines, with the syntax
  {$var}, {%var}, {?var[0]}.  {|$ etc can be used if literal output is
  required.

  Remove altogether the distinction between END_1BYTE_CHAR and other
  end states.  The only thing it was doing was causing whitespace to
  be ignored (often unexpectedly) when printing text.

  Add a command-line option to specify a script filename.  Among other
  things, this will make it much easier to have a range of different
  test scripts.  The relatively unimportant -s flag has been
  repurposed for this; the old -s can still be accessed with its long
  name --save.


2008-12-26

  Write some manpages at last.

  Fix `puttext' command.

  The distinction between string literal quoting types is now clearly
  defined: ~tags~ are parsed in ^...^ strings, and treated as literal
  in "..." strings.  "^..." strings are treated identically to "..."
  strings.  There is no other difference in behaviour whatsoever.

  
2008-12-19

  New command `watch_var' logs all changes to an (integer) variable,
  so you can figure out why on earth it's got the wrong value.


2008-12-16

  Fix occasional segfaults during subtitled movies.  This is a quick
  and dirty fix, and should ideally be replaced with something more
  robust.


2008-12-14

  Fix infinite loop caused by a line of the form "^\n" when a
  pretextgosub hook is defined.

  Make @ behave as expected when embedded in lines, even when a
  textgosub hook is defined.

  Add shortcuts #@, #\, etc, for printing literal characters.

  Add ponscripter-mode.el (Emacs syntax highlighting)


2008-11-18

  Fix fatal error caused by ~~ in a script becoming ~ in the lookback
  buffer.


2008-09-09

  New command `vsp_when' allows sprite visibility to be linked
  automatically to auto-mode status.

  Fix auto-mode so that all sprites start animating again immediately
  when the player terminates auto-mode during a page pause.

  Hack SDL to add a fixed-aspect-ratio mode for widescreen displays.


2008-03-26

  Add h_textheight command to facilitate footnote positioning in
  Narci2.

  h_locate now adds the equivalent of ~x...y...~ to the lookback
  buffer, so pages using it will appear correctly in lookback mode.

  Add gettextspeed command to determine the current text speed.

  Tweak line wrapping code; formatting commands no longer count as
  break points, and formatting changes are always taken into account
  when wrapping.
  

2008-03-11

  Fix random number generation; the first instance of rnd in a program
  will no longer produce predictable results.

  Fix built-in load menu line truncation.

  Fix bug causing text to be missing when coming out of skip mode.


2008-03-09

  Get Vista working properly (?).

  Add Mion's workaround to fix sample rate mismatches in MPEG
  playback.

  Merge across the upstream ONScripter enhancements (mostly
  sp2-related) that Mion has integrated into ONScripter-En.

  
2008-02-25

  Improve diagnostics slightly.

  Extend vsp, csp, (a)msp, and cell to provide some convenient
  shorthands, tablegoto to provide a 1-based alternative, and add
  movz, which is like movl but treats missing args as implicit zeroes.

  Merge across the RC version synchronisation code from ONScripter-En.

  
2008-01-27

  Revert setwindow and locate commands to the NScripter behaviour
  (sizes defined in characters not pixels) in all cases, to simplify
  porting.  A new h_locate command is provided as a pixel-oriented
  replacement for locate, while a much improved pixel-oriented
  setwindow replacement is already available in the form of
  h_usewindow.

  Filenames are now checked for non-ASCII text; finding any is
  considered an error.  Life's too short to implement a fully general
  cross-platform encoding-independent file access mechanism, and
  frankly ASCII is good enough -- we're talking arbitrary identifier
  tokens here, not _literature_.

  Games were randomly segfaulting on my computer, and the problem
  seemed to be related to string handling, so I've taken the
  opportunity to get rid of the horrid pstring interface and replace
  it with something a little saner, based on bstrlib.  Now it doesn't
  segfault any more.

  Fixed some other architectural oddities, notably the far-too-early
  substitution of ligatures; this now doesn't take place until we're
  actually trying to access glyphs, and consequentially we can stop
  worrying about ligature substitution mangling filenames, and we can
  ignore ligature definitions where there's no suitable glyph in the
  active font.

  
2007-10-08

  Support for soft subtitles in MPEG playback (but not, at present, in
  AVI playback).

  Add command logsp2utf -- equivalent to logsp2, but for UTF-8 text.

  Various bug fixes: interaction between default styles and saved
  games, ludicrously inefficient ligature searching, handling of
  overlapping sprite-buttons.

  Remove support for obsolete ONScripter-format saved games.

  
2007-09-25

  Implement h_defwindow, h_usewindow, h_usewindow3: create and use
  predefined sets of window settings.

  Implement h_speedpercent: adjust all font speed settings
  proportionately with a single convenient command.

  
2007-07-15

  Fix glyph positioning and a number of OS X build bugs.

  
2007-06-16

  Merge recent portability enhancements from ONScripter-En: configure
  now works properly on a wider range of Unixes, and generates an
  `install' target as documented.

  
2007-05-14

  Improve path handling: all paths are now specified explicitly. 

  Full file handling is partly rewritten in a higher-level manner as a
  prelude to making things encoding-independent, but direct access to
  files with non-ASCII filenames is still very much dependent on a
  UTF-8 filesystem.

  
2007-05-13

  The game identifier can now be derived from caption or versionstr
  commands if the ;gameid directive is absent.

  
2007-04-28

  Ponscripter games now use slightly different script filenames.
  Limited support for NScripter scripts added; output is by no means
  identical with ONScripter, and many things will not work, but some
  NScripter games are now playable with proportional text (even
  proportional Japanese text!) without any porting.

  Reimplement the clickstr function.

  Fix bug in selectcolor implementation that was causing select
  colours to be lost whenever the interpreter was reset.


2007-04-25

  Merge in an adapted version of the `drawfix' patch to speed up
  screen updates in windowed mode, plus a number of other patches:

  Reduce flicker when sprites are changed (Roine Gustafsson)

  Fix gcc detection on OS X (Roine)

  Support multiple games without game IDs at the same time (Roine)

  Fix incorrect clipping of text shadow (Roine)


2007-04 (passim)

  Major cleanup of source code, including conversion of many aspects
  to use C++ idioms and STL containers.


2007-04-15

  Merge in useful fixes from onscripter-20070206.


2007-01

  Redesign build system to support automatic platform/dependency
  detection and to allow bundling of dependencies.  This makes it
  plausible to distribute the Linux version as source code, since a
  straight configure-make cycle should finally "just work".

  Reimplement menu handling initially stripped out during
  proportionalisation.  Right-click menus now function as in
  ONScripter.  Built-in save/load menus take advantage of proportional
  text to display in automatically-formatted columns.

  
2006-11-30

  Increase flexibility of file embedding.  Font files can now be
  embedded in the executable: embedded fonts will be used only if the
  file is not found in the data directory or in the game archive.
  Icon embedding is now optional; the embedded icon, if present, will
  be used only if "icon.png" is not found in the working directory.
  The new system could easily be expanded to allow other files to be
  embedded, including game data.
  

2006-11-22

  Implement default data/save separation for Windows and Linux
  too. This should enhance Vista compatibility considerably, and make
  it possible to package Linux versions in a way that respects the
  FHS.

  
2006-11-21

  Implement ligature customisation.
  
  Integers can now be expressed in hexadecimal with an 0x prefix, as
  in C.

  
2006-09-24

  Replace SDL_ttf with a simpler, saner C++ interface (the
  implementation still being largely drawn from SDL_ttf, of course).

  Convert horizontal font positioning to use floating-point rather
  than integer offsets.  Begin attempts at subpixel positioning (still
  buggy).
  
  In the process, glyph caching has been removed.  ONScripter uses
  _two_ glyph caches (!) -- one in SDL_ttf, which apparently only
  works on ASCII characters anyway, and one in
  ONScripterLabel. However, the speed of text rendering does not seem
  to be affected at all by removing caching, suggesting that it's a
  premature optimisation.  The code is simplified considerably by its
  removal.

  
2006-09-18

  Multi-font-style support.

  
2006-09-14

  Automatic ligature support.

  
2006-09-08

  Default icon embedded in interpreter.  (This is game-specific; users
  are expected to use custom builds with these replaced.)

  
2006-09-06

  Fork.

  UTF-8 and proportional text support.
  
  Ruby, clickstr, and tategaki support removed.

  
2006-09-05 (as ONScripter)

  Make archive path and save path separately configurable.  Game data
  no longer has to be stored in a writable directory.
  
  OS X: make default archive path be the Resources folder of the
  application bundle, and default save path be a new subfolder of the
  user's Library/Preferences.  The name of the subfolder is derived
  from a new "game identifier" that should be specified at the top of
  0.txt with a ";gameid Whatever" line immediately after the modeline.
