This is a very basic set of tests.  Absolutely no pretence is made at
adequate coverage, as a simple glance at the code will prove.  All
they demonstrate is that Ponscripter is not _totally_ incompatible
with NScripter.  :)

I will note in passing that current versions of ONScripter do not pass
even these tests, though ONScripter-En does slightly better.

If you wish to try them, note that you will need to supply a font
yourself.  Note also that NScripter 2.49 or better is required -
earlier versions do not support commands like itoa2.
