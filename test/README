This is a very basic set of tests.  Absolutely no pretence is made at
significant coverage, as a simple glance at the code will prove.  All
they demonstrate is that Ponscripter is not _totally_ incompatible
with NScripter.  :)

Interestingly, they reveal a number of problems with current versions
of ONScripter... even ONScripter-En.  (I really must get round to
fixing those!)

If you wish to try them, note that you will need to supply a font
yourself.  Note also that you will need an up-to-date NScripter if you
wish to try that; the mere fact that it came with a recent game does
not guarantee that any nscr.exe is up-to-date, so get it straight from
Takahashi Naoki's website.
