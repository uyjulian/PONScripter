--- OVERVIEW

Ponscripter is a fork of ogapee's ONScripter, which in turn is an
enhanced clone of NScripter.

While ONScripter adds basic support for Western text to the NScripter
system, it does so only insofar as is easily done while retaining
compatibility with unmodified Japanese games.  ONScripter-En takes
things slightly further, but good English support requires fundamental
changes.  Hence Ponscripter, which builds on the ONScripter source
code, but removes many Japanese-specific features (vertical text,
ruby), makes some fundamental architectural changes to better support
Western games (proportionally spaced text, scripts encoded as UTF-8
rather than Shift_JIS), and adds some generally nice features like
support for multiple fonts and text styles in the process.

The end result is a somewhat less stable and VASTLY less compatible
engine -- but it sure does look a lot better when it works.

I must repeat this for emphasis: unlike ONScripter-En, this engine is
NOT designed for playing NScripter or ONScripter games!  While it is
generally capable of running them to some extent, it is not fully
compatible, and problems are very likely to occur.  Non-Ponscripter
games may be considered essentially unsupported, and fixing bugs in
them will be a very low priority indeed.

To put it another way, consider what you want:

Q. Are you are a user or developer who wants a portable game engine
  that works well with both Japanese and English games, and that
  strives to implement an NScripter-compatible system conforming to
  all the games and technical documentation out there?

A. Avoid Ponscripter like the plague and stick with ONScripter, or
  ONScripter-En if you want slightly better English support.

Q. Are you an adventurous user who wants to experiment with an
  unstable system that might in some circumstances be able to enhance
  your gaming experience, or might break it in unexpected ways?

A. Feel free to try Ponscripter on NScripter/ONScripter games.  But
  back up your saved games first, and don't be at all surprised if it
  doesn't work at all.

Q. Are you a translator or developer who wants pretty Western text on
  Windows, MacOS X, and X11, and is willing to work to get it?

A. Porting your game to Ponscripter is likely to be easier than
  rewriting from scratch in Ren'Py.

Note that Ponscripter is still very much a work in progress.  What
little documentation there is can be found in the file "MANUAL".  If
you use this, you do so at your own risk, and Haeleth will not be held
liable for any damage that ensues.

Also, do NOT bother ogapee with any bugs or problems you encounter.
This is a heavily modified fork.  I have fiddled around with the
source code to the extent that many critical parts have been changed
beyond all recognition.  It is incredibly unlikely that any bugs you
find are anything to do with ogapee.


--- COMPATIBILITY

The standard Ponscripter build requires a generally-POSIX-compatible 
build environment with GNU make -- on Windows this means MinGW + MSYS
-- and is only extensively tested using the GNU compiler suite.  Most
of my testing is carried out on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu 7.10     x86_64 (primary development platform)
* MacOS X 10.4    i386   (built as universal binary)
* Windows Vista   i386

Releases are also confirmed to build and launch on the following
secondary platforms/configurations:

* Ubuntu 7.10     i386
* Ubuntu 7.10     x86_64 (using Intel compiler)
* Windows 2000    i386
* Windows Vista   x86_64
* Fedora 7        x86_64
* Solaris 10      x86_64
* FreeBSD 6.2     x86_64
* OpenBSD 4.1     i386
* NetBSD 3.1      x86_64


--- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Ponscripter is built primarily on Ogapee's work, without which there
would be nothing here.

The version of ONScripter taken as a base also includes notable
contributions from Chendo (original English support) and insani
(further enhancements).  I have not attempted to quantify how much of
their work remains in this version; even if much of it has been
replaced, they still deserve recognition for bringing English support
to the NScripter world in the first place.

The following people (in alphabetical order) have contributed 
noteworthy patches and bug reports that have enhanced Ponscripter:

  Mion of Sonozaki Futago-tachi
  Roine Gustafsson
  Roto
  Starchanchan

Apologies to anyone I've missed - please let me know so I can set the
record straight!
