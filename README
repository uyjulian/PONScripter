Ponscripter ("Proportional ONScripter") is a fork of ogapee's
ONScripter, which in turn is an enhanced clone of NScripter.

While ONScripter adds basic support for Western text to the NScripter
system, it does so only insofar as is easily done while retaining
compatibility with unmodified Japanese games.  Ponscripter builds on
the ONScripter source code, but removes many Japanese-specific
features (vertical text, ruby), and makes some fundamental
architectural changes to better support Western games (proportionally
spaced text, scripts encoded as UTF-8 rather than Shift_JIS).

The end result is a somewhat less stable and VASTLY less compatible
engine -- but it sure does look a lot better when it works.

I must repeat this for emphasis: unlike ONScripter, this engine is NOT
designed for playing NScripter or ONScripter games!  While it is
generally capable of running them to some extent, it is not fully
compatible, and problems are very likely to occur.  Non-Ponscripter
games may be considered unsupported, and fixing bugs in them will be a
very low priority indeed.

To put it another way, consider what you want:

- If you are a user or developer who wants a portable game engine that
  works well with both Japanese and English games, and that strives to
  implement an NScripter-compatible system conforming to all the games
  and technical documentation out there, then avoid Ponscripter like
  the plague and stick with ONScripter, which does an admirable job at
  that.

- If you are an adventurous user who wants to experiment with an
  unstable system that might in some circumstances be able to enhance
  your gaming experience, then feel free to try Ponscripter.  But
  back up your saved games first, and don't be at all surprised if it
  doesn't work.

- If you are a developer who wants pretty Western text on Windows,
  MacOS X, or X11, and if you are willing to work to get it, then
  porting your game to Ponscripter is likely to be easier than
  rewriting from scratch in Ren'Py, but don't expect it to be
  effortless.

Note that Ponscripter is still very much a work in progress.  What
little documentation there is can be found in the file
"README.ponscripter".  If you use this, you do so at your own risk,
and Haeleth will not be held liable for any damage that ensues.

Also, do NOT report bugs or problems you encounter to ogapee.  It is
incredibly unlikely that they are anything to do with him.
