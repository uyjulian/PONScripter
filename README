PONScripter is a fork of ogapee's ONScripter, which in turn is an enhanced clone 
of NScripter.

While ONScripter adds basic support for Western text, it does so only insofar as 
is easily done while retaining compatibility with unmodified Japanese games. 
PONScripter builds on the ONScripter source code, but removes many 
Japanese-specific features (vertical text, ruby), and makes some fundamental 
architectural changes to better support Western games (proportionally spaced 
text, scripts encoded as UTF-8 rather than Shift_JIS).

The end result is a somewhat less stable and VASTLY less compatible engine -- 
but it more than makes up for that by making games look good, if one takes the 
time to convert them to make proper use of the new capabilities.

If you want a portable game engine that works well with both Japanese and 
English games, and that strives to implement an NScripter-compatible system that 
conforms to all the games and technical documentation out there, then avoid 
PONScripter like the plague and stick with ONScripter, which does an admirable 
job at that. If you want pretty Western text, and are willing to work to get it, 
then converting your game to PONScripter is likely to be easier than rewriting 
from scratch in Ren'Py.

Note that PONScripter is still very much a work in progress: it is largely
untested, and there is very little detailed documentation of the many changes.
If you use this, you do so at your own risk, and I will not be held liable for
any damage that ensues.

Please do not bug ogapee with any problems you encounter herein.  (In fact, 
please don't bug me with them either, unless you're using a binary I built to 
run a game I intended it to run, or else unless you have solutions to offer.)
