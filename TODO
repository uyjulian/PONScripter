* Tags

Tags are processed when text is read, i.e. in a display text block or
when constructing a sprite.  Text that is not obviously going to be
displayed simply doesn't get tags processed. This may be a limitation
that should be revisited.

* Ligatures

It should now be feasible to ignore ligature definitions where the
substitute character isn't present in the selected font.  So we should
probably do that, really, shouldn't we?

* Not gonna happen any time soon

Kill pushed_variable, current_variable, and so forth
