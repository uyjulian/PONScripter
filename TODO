* Ideas

Embed default fonts into binaries (configurable).


* Upstream ONScripter / ONScripter-En

Merge in some changes.  We're missing useful functions like
   windowchip that are implemented there.


* WBNI

Sane parser.  Maybe even bytecode.  Should be more or less feasible
   now; doc/prototypes could be used to generate a Yacc-type grammar,
   I think...

   
* Not gonna happen any time soon

Kill current_variable.  Purge it with fire.
